> #### Docker, perfect for test-driving Jenkins

> When Jenkins 2.0 was released I wanted to take it for a test drive, the perfect way to do this was through Docker. Docker means zero  commitment to installing packages and configuring your system. Even installing Java could take you on a 30-60min hour detour, Official, prebuilt images in the Docker Hub completely eliminates that and gives you near instant access to pre-packaged software.

> I started off by looking at the official instructions for starting a Jenkins 2.0 container. They give 3-4 variations of the `docker run` command but this can be made much simpler through the use of Docker Compose and a `docker-compose.yml` file.
